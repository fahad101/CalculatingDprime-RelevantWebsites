The way to fix this is as follows:

Calculate a minimum and maximum score for your data.

It is possible that a respondent detects every signal, giving a hit rate of H = 1.00, or a respondent might make no false alarms giving FA = 0. A right-tail p value of 0 corresponds to z = infinity while a p value of 1 corresponds to z =negative infinity. This poses a problem for computing dâ€™!

A conventional adjustment is to set the minimum p = 1/N where N is the number of trials used in the calculation of p. We set the maximum value for p = (N-1)/N.

To correct the #NUM error, just change the participants perfect hit rate
from 1.000 to 0.995 and/or any individual false alarm rate of 0.000 to
.005. I would also double check you calculation of HR-FAR for the CWs
and NCWs of the older participants, as I do not think they are all
correct.
